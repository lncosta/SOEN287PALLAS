                        <summary>What is Pallas Entertainment?</summary>
                        <p class="text">Pallas Entertainment is a event entertainment and performance company. We offer services from children's party entertainment to festival-level circus acts. We are a Montreal-based entertainment company that provides acts and performances to bring life to events big and small.</p>

                        <summary>Why the name Pallas?</summary>
                        <p class="text">The name Pallas is the given epithet of Ancient Greek goddess Athena, associated with wisdom and handicraft. We thought those were important elements to bring to the entertainment industry, and look to the godess Athena as a source of motivation.

                        <summary>Who invented Pallas?</summary>
                        <p class="text">A group of Concordia Univeristy students had the idea for Pallas Entertainment for a course project. Then, a few of our more artistic-inclined members decided to join in. We started as just a group of friends trying to build upon our hobbies, and now we are a full-fledged, world-recognized company. What a ride!.

To refund a performance, the booker must contact us through our phone (123-456-7890) at least a week before the event date. Events cancelled last-minute (up to three days before the performance) will result in a fee equivalent to 60% of the event quote. Events cancelled any later will result in the booker being charged the full price.

                            there is a chance that the ticket is already sold out and there is a delay to the information. If you curious about why the payment is not successful, you 
                            can write an email to customer service. Usually is takes 48 hours for an answer.
