                  <br/>
                  <p class = "white">Regarding my juggling skills, I focus on gyroscopic juggling being a type of object manipulation using objects spinning around an axis, such as the diabolo and the devil stick.</p>
                  <p class = "white">There is also bubble art and science which consists in manipulating soap bubbles. Basically, a soap bubble is made up of three layers, being a layer of water between two layers of soap. Soap bubbles tend to become spherical no matter what their original shape was, and this can be explained due to the fact that they want to minimize their surface area. With this last property we can understand that when two soap bubbles meet, they will merge and a wall will appear.</p>
                  <p class = "white">Consequently, with those principles we can create a countless number of visual effects.</p>
